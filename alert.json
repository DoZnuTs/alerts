I have created a new applet called 'SELs' to get around this limitation if you only need to request tickets. Please use this new applet for requesting batch tickets for future use, it has a similar process to the previous PDF upload functionality. Simply open a planogram using the button in the top left, bays will load in on the left and everything else is the same. Thank you."
